Welcome to AeroPy's, an easy to use aerodynamic tool
==================================================================
AeroPy is an library for calculating aerodynamic properties. The main feature of
this library is the Python interface with XFOIL. The main objective of this library is to be able 
to use XFOIL via Python iteratively in a total of 4 lines total (one line for most uses). 
Through this interface coupling with other softwares (Abaqus, Ansys, etc) is possible
and iterative processes (optimization, design sensitivity) are possible.
For a thorough explanation please check the documentation and the tutorials.

To Do
======

- Include asymmetric wing
- Create airfoil and wing classes

Recommended Collaborations
==========================

Please use and adapt this library to your needs. There are several
functionalities I wished to implement, but did not have the time. Hence
I am *strongly* recommending the following collaborations:

- Airfoil generator with a GUI
- Atmospheric module (use the library already available in aero_module)
- Extend aero_module for wings with non-constant cross sections

Examples
==================

A simple example demonstrating how to use AeroPy to calculate lift, drag and
moment coefficients for a NACA0012 airfoil at angle of attack of 12 degrees.

.. code-block:: python

    from AeroPy import find_coefficients
    find_coefficients(airfoil='naca0012'alpha=12.)
    >>> {'CM': 0.0134, 'CL': 1.2453, 'Top_Xtr': 0.0194, 'CD': 0.01934, 'CDp': 0.01379, 'alpha': 12.0, 'Bot_Xtr': 1.0}

Another example showing how to use AeroPy to calculate pressure coefficients for a
NACA0012 in viscous flow at Reynolds = 10000000 and angle of attack of 12 degrees

.. code-block:: python

    from AeroPy import find_pressure_coefficients
    find_pressure_coefficients(airfoil='naca0012', Reynolds = 1e6, alpha=12.,NACA=True)
    >>> 'y': [0.00126, ..., -0.00126], 'x': [1.0, ..., 1.0], 'Cp': [0.41501, ..., 0.41501]}
